This is a set of accessible flashcards using json files to store the content of the flashcards for different lessons. 
There are audible instructions that are only triggered if an enduser is using a screen reader or keyboard commands to navigate.
The audible instructions read as follows:

- Welcome to Accessible Flashcards. 
- Use the Tab (or Arrow keys on NVDA or Jaws) to navigate through the cards. 
- Use Shift-Tab to navigate to a previous card. 
- Use the Enter key or Spacebar to flip a card and reveal the answer. 
- On NVDA and Jaws, use the Read Current Line command (Insert+I or Insert+L, depending on which screen reader is being used) to read the text on a card. 
- On Mac VoiceOver, use the right or left arrow to read the text on a card. This section is only visible to screen readers.
